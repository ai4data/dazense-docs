dazense is described as "The #1 Open-Source Analytics Agent" and functions as a framework for building and deploying analytics agents.

## Core Functionality

Data teams can establish agent context using the dazense-core CLI, incorporating data, metadata, modeling, and rules. The platform enables deployment of a user interface allowing stakeholders to interact with the agent and perform analytics operations.

## Key Features for Data Teams

The platform provides an "Open Context Builder" allowing teams to construct a file-system-like context with unlimited additions including data, metadata, documentation, tools, and MCPs. It maintains data stack agnosticism, functioning across any data warehouse, technology stack, context type, or LLM.

Teams gain "Agent Reliability Visibility" through unit testing capabilities before deployment, with context versioning and performance tracking over time. The self-hosted architecture with custom LLM keys ensures security.

## Key Features for Business Users

Business users can pose questions in natural language and receive analytics results immediately. The platform includes native data visualization creation and customization within the chat interface, transparent agent reasoning display, and feedback mechanisms for data teams.

## Getting Started

A quickstart guide is available at `/dazense-agent/quickstart` for deploying an initial analytics agent rapidly.
