> Create the perfect context for your analytics agent

## Why a Context Builder?

The Context Builder helps you build a file-system for your agent. This way you can have a full transparent view on the context your agent has access to, and engineer the right way to:

1. **Make it reliable for users** - Ensure consistent, accurate responses
2. **Make it optimized** - Reduce costs, tokens usage, and improve speed

Context is built with dazense using a CLI. The CLI will initialize your context repository and sync your context within this repo.

## How It Works

dazense uses a file-system approach to organize context:

```
your-project/
├── dazense_config.yaml                    # Main configuration
├── RULES.md                           # Agent behavior rules
├── agent/                             # Agent tools and integrations
│   ├── mcps/                          # Model Context Protocols
│   └── tools/                         # Custom tools
├── databases/                         # Database context
├── docs/                              # Documentation files
├── repos/                             # Cloned repositories
├── semantics/                         # Semantic context
└── queries/                           # Example queries
```
