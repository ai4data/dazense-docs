Business rules are guardrails that prevent incorrect metrics (for example, excluding cancelled orders from revenue).

## Define rules

Create `semantics/business_rules.yml`:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: cancelled_orders_excluded
    category: metrics
    severity: critical
    applies_to: [orders.total_revenue, orders.avg_order_value]
    description: Revenue metrics must exclude cancelled orders
    guidance: Always filter status != 'cancelled' when computing revenue

  - name: test_customers
    category: data_quality
    severity: warning
    applies_to: [customers]
    description: Test customers exist in the data
    guidance: Filter out customer_id > 100 for production analysis
```

## Best practices

- Keep critical rules short and unambiguous.
- Attach rules to specific metrics where possible.
- Use `warning` for data quality caveats and `info` for guidance.
- Keep additional narrative context in `RULES.md`.
