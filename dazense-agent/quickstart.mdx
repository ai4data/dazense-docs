## Step 1: Install dazense-core package

```bash
pip install dazense-core
```

## Step 2: Initialize a dazense project

```bash
dazense init
```

This command will ask you:

* To name your project
* If you want to connect a database *(optional)*
* If you want to add a repo in agent context *(optional)*
* To add an LLM key *(optional)*
* If you want to setup a Slack connection *(optional)*

<Note>
You can skip any optional question and configure them later in your `dazense_config.yaml` file.
</Note>

This will create:

* A new folder with your project name
* An architecture for your context files
* A `dazense_config.yaml` configuration file
* A `RULES.md` file

## Step 3: Verify your setup

cd to the project folder and run:

```bash
dazense debug
```

This command checks your configuration and displays any issues.

## Step 4: Synchronize your context

```bash
dazense sync
```

This will populate your context folder with your context files (data, metadata, repos, etc.).

## Step 5: Launch the chat and ask questions

You have two options to access the chat UI:

### Option 1: Using dazense chat command

```bash
dazense chat
```

This will start the dazense chat UI. It will open the chat interface in your browser at `http://localhost:5005`.

### Option 2: Using Docker

Instead of `dazense chat`, you can use Docker to run the UI:

**With built-in example:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name dazense \
  -p 5005:5005 \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:5005 \
  metazense/dazense:latest
```

**With your project:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name dazense \
  -p 5005:5005 \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:5005 \
  -v /path/to/your/project:/app/project \
  -e DAZENSE_DEFAULT_PROJECT_PATH=/app/project \
  metazense/dazense:latest
```

Access the UI at `http://localhost:5005` and add your LLM API key in the settings.

From there, you can start asking questions to your agent!

## Step 6: Evaluate your agent

First, create a folder tests/ with questions and expected SQL in yaml.
Then, measure agent's performance on examples with dazense test command:

```bash
dazense test
```

View results in tests panel:

```bash
dazense test server
```
