title: Slack Bot
description: "The dazense Slack bot brings your analytics agent directly into Slack, allowing your team to ask questions and get insights without leaving their workspace."
---

When configured, the dazense Slack bot:

* Listens for mentions in Slack channels
* Processes questions using the same agent as the web chat interface
* Returns answers with SQL queries, data tables, and visualizations
* Maintains conversation context within Slack threads

<Note>The Slack bot uses the same agent context, rules, and capabilities as your web chat interface. Any improvements to your agent automatically benefit Slack users.</Note>

### Step 6: Add Bot to Channels

1. In Slack, go to any channel where you want the bot
2. Type `/invite @dazense-chat` (or your bot's name)
3. The bot will now listen for mentions in that channel

## Usage

**Ask Questions**

Mention the bot in any channel where it's been added:

```
@dazense-chat What were our top 5 products by revenue last month?
```

The bot will:

1. Process your question using the same agent as the web interface
2. Generate SQL queries based on your context
3. Execute queries against your connected databases
4. Return results in a formatted Slack message
5. Send you the link to the full conversation to open it in browser UI

**Thread Conversations**

Follow-up questions in the thread maintain context:

```
@dazense-chat What were our top 5 products by revenue last month?
# ... bot responds ...

@dazense-chat Can you break that down by region?
# ... bot responds with regional breakdown ...
```

<Note>The bot replies in threads to keep conversations organized. Make sure to reply in the thread for follow-up questions. You need to use @dazense-chat at every question, even in thread, for the bot to see it.</Note>

**Stop Conversations**

While generating, you will see a "stop generation" button appear in the slack conversation.
Click on that button if you want to stop the chat from generating more text.
