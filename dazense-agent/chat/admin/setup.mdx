---

## Access the admin panel

The admin views are exposed from the same server as the chat UI.

1. Start dazense chat locally (see the [chat overview](/dazense-agent/chat/overview) for details).
2. Sign in with an admin-capable account.
3. Navigate to the admin section from the UI navigation.

The admin panel includes sections for:

* **Project** - General project settings and Google OAuth
* **Models** - LLM provider configuration
* **Agent** - Agent settings and template prompts
* **MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol server configuration
* **Slack** - Slack bot integration
* **Team** - User management

## Add Users

User management is available for deployed instances. If you're running dazense locally with `dazense chat`, user management is not required. For deployment instructions, see the [Deployment Guide](/dazense-agent/self-hosting/deployment-guide).

**To add a new user to a project:**

1. Navigate to **Team** in the left sidebar.
2. Click the **+** button in the top right of the Users panel.
3. Enter the user's email address
4. The user will then have to sign in with its email address and the generated password.

If you want to let users sign up autonomously, you can setup Google OAuth - see in next section.

The first user to sign up after deployment automatically becomes an admin. Additional users must be added through the admin interface. For more details on deploying dazense, see the [Deployment Guide](/dazense-agent/self-hosting/deployment-guide#step-5-customize-your-setup).

## Configure Google OAuth

Google OAuth configuration is for deployed instances. This allows users to sign in with their Google accounts instead of manually created accounts. For deployment instructions, see the [Deployment Guide](/dazense-agent/self-hosting/deployment-guide#step-5-customize-your-setup).

Enable Google sign-in for your team and control which domains can self-register.

**Step 1: Create Google OAuth Credentials**

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** -> **Credentials**
4. Click **Create Credentials** -> **OAuth client ID**
5. Configure the OAuth consent screen if prompted
6. Select **Web application** as the application type
7. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   ```
   https://your-deployed-instance-url/api/auth/callback/google
   ```
8. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

**Step 2: Configure in dazense Admin Panel**

1. Navigate to **Project** in the admin sidebar
2. Scroll to the **Google Credentials** section
3. Under **Google OAuth (Override Env)**, enter your **Client ID**
4. Click the **ENV** button to manage environment variables if needed
5. Set the following environment variables in your deployment:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
   ```

**Step 3: Configure Allowed Domains**

To restrict sign-up to specific email domains:

1. Set the `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` environment variable:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=dazense.metazense.com,example.com
   ```
2. Only users with email addresses from these domains will be able to sign up

<Warning>
If you configure Google OAuth, users can sign in with their Google accounts. Make sure to set allowed domains if you want to restrict access to your organization.
</Warning>

## Configure Slack integration

Connect your dazense agent to Slack so your team can ask questions directly in Slack channels.

Configure Slack integration from the **Slack** section in the admin sidebar, or see the [Slack Bot guide](/dazense-agent/chat/slack) for detailed setup instructions.

## Choose LLM models

Configure which LLM providers and models are available to your agent.

**Configure API Keys**

In the **Models** section of the admin panel:

* **If no API key exists in your environment variables**: Enter your LLM API key directly in the UI
* **If an API key exists in your environment variables**: You can override it by entering a different key in the UI

Environment variables take precedence over UI configuration by default. Entering a key in the UI allows you to override the environment variable for that provider.

**Select Available Models**

Control which models your users can access by providing the model ID from your LLM provider:

1. Navigate to **Models** in the admin sidebar
2. Add or edit a provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, or OpenRouter)
3. Enter the **model ID** for each model you want to make available
4. Users will only be able to select from the models you've configured

Model IDs are provider-specific. For example:

* Anthropic: `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-opus-4`, `claude-haiku-4`
* OpenAI: `gpt-4`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`
* Google: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`
* Mistral: `mistral-large-latest`, `mistral-medium-latest`
* OpenRouter: Various models from multiple providers

**Supported LLM Providers**

dazense supports the following LLM providers:

* **Anthropic** - Claude models
* **OpenAI** - GPT models
* **Google** - Gemini models
* **Mistral** - Mistral AI models
* **OpenRouter** - Access to multiple models from various providers through a single API

## Configure Template Prompts

Customize prompt suggestions for your users in the chat.

These prompts will be shown to your users in a new chat. These can be used to give your users examples of questions they can send to the chat.

1. Navigate to **Agent** in the admin sidebar
2. Look for **Template Prompts** section
3. Add example prompts that users can click to get started, such as:
   * "What were our top 5 products by revenue last month?"
   * "Show me user signups by country for the past quarter"
   * "Compare this month's sales to last month"
   * "What's the average order value by customer segment?"

These template prompts help users understand what types of questions they can ask and provide quick-start examples for common analytics queries.
