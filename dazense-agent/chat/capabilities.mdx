## Key Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English and get instant answers
- **Data Visualization**: Automatically generate charts and graphs from your data
- **Transparent Reasoning**: See the SQL queries and logic behind each answer
- **Conversation History**: Navigate through past queries and build on previous answers

## How It Works

The agent processes questions through five sequential steps:

1. **Context Discovery** - Searches and reads context files to understand the data model, business definitions, and rules
2. **Query Generation** - Writes optimized SQL queries based on the context
3. **Execution** - Runs the query against connected databases
4. **Visualization** - Creates charts when appropriate to display data
5. **Response** - Summarizes findings in plain language with sources and reasoning

## Agent Tools

The dazense agent includes six autonomous tools:

- **execute_sql** - Executes SQL queries against connected databases, supporting multiple connections and returning structured results
- **display_chart** - Creates visualizations (bar, line, and pie charts) from query results with customizable styling
- **search** - Searches for files matching glob patterns within project context
- **list** - Lists files and directories at specified paths to help navigate project structure
- **read** - Reads context files including SQL models, documentation, and business definitions
- **grep** - Searches text patterns across context files using regex with filtering options

The agent automatically orchestrates these tools based on your question without requiring manual tool specification.
