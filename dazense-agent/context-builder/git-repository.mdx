## Why Use Git?

* **Version Control** — Track changes to your context files
* **Collaboration** — Multiple team members can contribute
* **Automated Sync** — Set up automated sync through GitHub Actions
* **Deployment** — Easy integration with cloud deployments
* **Backup** — Your context is safely stored in the cloud

## Setup Steps

### 1. Initialize Git

Navigate to your dazense project directory and initialize Git:

```bash
cd my-analytics-agent
git init
```

### 2. Create .gitignore

Exclude sensitive files from version control:

```
.env
credentials/
venv/
```

### 3. Update Configuration

Replace file paths with environment variables in `dazense_config.yaml`:

```yaml
databases:
  - name: bigquery-prod
    type: bigquery
    project_id: my-project
    dataset_id: analytics
    credentials_json: {{ env('GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON') }}
```

### 4. Commit Files

Stage and commit your project:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial dazense project setup"
```

### 5. Create GitHub Repo

Create a new repository on GitHub without initializing additional files (no README, no .gitignore, no license).

### 6. Connect Remote

Add the remote origin and push:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-org/my-analytics-agent.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Security

<Warning>Never commit credentials or API keys to Git! Always use environment variables or secret management systems.</Warning>

* Use environment variables for local development
* Use secret management systems for cloud deployments
* Use GitHub Secrets for GitHub Actions

## Deployment

For Cloud Run deployment:

* Connect your GitHub repository to Cloud Build
* Use Secret Manager for credentials
* Configure environment variables in Cloud Run settings
