## Purpose

Adding repositories allows your agent to:

* Access dbt model definitions and documentation
* Access your semantic layer repository
* Reference internal documentation

## Setup Methods

**Interactive Setup:**

Run the initialization command to add repositories interactively:

```bash
dazense init
```

**Configuration File:**

Add repositories to your `dazense_config.yaml`:

```yaml
repositories:
  - name: dbt_project
    url: https://github.com/your-org/dbt-project
```

## Synchronization

**Sync Command:**

```bash
dazense sync
```

This process performs these steps:

1. Clone or pull the repository
2. Extract relevant files from the specified path
3. Index the content for the agent
4. Make it searchable

**Storage Location:**

After syncing, your repositories are stored in this structure:

```
context/
└── repos/
    └── dbt_project/
```

The output includes a full clone of your git repository in the repos/ folder.
