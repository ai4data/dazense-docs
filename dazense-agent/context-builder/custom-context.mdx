title: Custom Context
description: "Your context repository is just a file system — you have complete freedom to organize and customize it."

## What You Can Do

* **Create new folders** organized by team, domain, project, or any structure you prefer
* **Add any context** you think is relevant for your agent
* **Use any format** — Markdown, YAML, SQL, JSON, CSV, and more

## Common Context Types

Here are some common types of context teams add:

* **Business Definitions** — Define key metrics like "active customer," "revenue," etc.
* **Query Examples** — Validated SQL queries that your team uses as reference
* **Dashboard References** — Links to trusted dashboards and reports
* **Glossary & FAQs** — Common terminology, acronyms, and frequently asked questions
* **Data Quality Notes** — Known data limitations, timezone issues, caveats

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Keep your custom context organized and modular. Ensure each metric has only one canonical definition, and organize context by domain.
