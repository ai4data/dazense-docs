## AI generated commits

In the commit form of dazense, there's a button for **"auto-generate commit message"**. Click it to have dazense AI analyze your changes and generate a clear, descriptive commit message automatically.

## Let dazense AI handle git

The dazense agent can handle all git operations for you:

* **Stage** files for commit
* **Commit** changes with appropriate messages
* **Push** commits to remote repositories
* **Pull** latest changes
* **Create PR** (Pull Request) for your changes

Simply ask dazense AI in the chat to perform any git operation, and the agent will execute it for you with your approval.
