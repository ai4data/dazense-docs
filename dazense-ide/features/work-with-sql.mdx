## Browse your database

You can browse available data from dazense's left panel in the "Warehouse" tab. From the data tree you can:

* View all tables available
* Search for a table
* Preview a table and see its list of columns
* Start a query on a table by clicking on `<…>` icon

**Tip:** Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> to open or close the left sidebar at any time.

## Write SQL queries

### Data warehouse console features

dazense provides the same features as any data warehouse console:

* **Auto-complete of tables and column names**: every time you type "space", a dropdown with available tables/columns will appear.
* **BigQuery dry run**: for BigQuery connections, dazense will show dry run results, with errors and cost of query in GB.

### AI auto-complete

On top of regular auto-complete, dazense's AI tab provides "AI suggestion" to complete your SQL code. These suggestions are based on your data and column metadata to suggest code matching your actual data schema.

### Fix SQL in chat

When your SQL has an error, use the "Fix in chat" button to send the query error to the agent for correction.

## Run SQL queries

In dazense, execute any SQL query by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⏎</kbd> (cmd + enter). You can also execute queries with dbt syntax if configured.

**Multi-query execution:**

* If you have multiple SQL queries in a single file, dazense will execute the query where your cursor is
* You can also select a portion of SQL and run it with <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⏎</kbd>

## Create SQL worksheets

You can create SQL worksheets within dazense for adhoc query writing. These worksheets are saved within dazense in the "SQL worksheets" tab.

To create a worksheet, click the **"+" button** from an SQL file, or go to the **"worksheet" tab** on the left panel. From this panel, you can rename, delete, or open your worksheets.

## Data preview

In dazense data preview you can:

* **Sorting**: Click column headers to sort data ascending or descending
* **Pagination**: Navigate through large result sets with pagination controls
* **Cell Selection**: Click to select individual cells
* **Row Selection**: Select entire rows for analysis
* **Column Selection**: Select entire columns
* **Zoom in Cell**: Double click on a cell to see the full value when it's truncated
* **Sum/Count Display**: See the sum and count of selected cells/rows in the preview
* **Export to csv**: Export query results to a csv file

**Keyboard Shortcut:** Open or close the data preview panel with <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>.

## Data diff

When you change SQL code, dazense allows you to preview corresponding changes in the data. Click on **"table diff"** in the preview section to see a highlighted version of additions and deletions in your data.

This table diff is based on the last commit of your branch. It shows data differences between running code in the last commit and current code of the file.
