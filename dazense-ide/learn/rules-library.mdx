## SQL Style Guidelines

**Standard SQL Formatting** recommends using CTEs for complex queries, snake_case naming conventions, business logic comments, explicit JOINs, and meaningful table aliases.

**dbt-Specific Rules** emphasize following the dbt style guide, including model documentation, using `ref()` functions instead of direct references, organizing related models together, and adding tests for critical models.

## Code Style Standards

**Python Development** requires PEP 8 compliance, type hints for function parameters, docstrings for all functions, and a 100-character maximum line length.

**General Code Practices** stress self-documenting code, focused functions, descriptive variable names, and comments for complex business logic.

## Team-Specific Standards

**Documentation Standards** mandate README.md files in new projects, environment variable documentation, maintained changelogs, and clear commit messages.

**Workflow Rules** establish feature branch requirements, pre-commit testing, code review processes, and documentation updates alongside code changes.

## Domain-Specific Practices

**Data Quality Rules** require data type validation, null value checks on critical columns, dbt data quality tests, and documented data sources and transformations.

**Analytics Rules** emphasize consistent metric definitions, documented calculation methods, timezone information in date fields, and validation against known benchmarks.

## Implementation Approach

Users should select templates matching their needs, customize for team standards, save as `.naorules` in the project root, and allow automatic agent integration. The documentation recommends starting with essential rules, regular reviews, team sharing, and agent testing.
