## Accessing dbt Configuration

The "dbt configuration" panel can be opened from the home page or the left side of the bottom bar.

## dbt Configuration Panel Steps

1. **Enable dbt**: Activate dbt detection within the interface.

2. **Pick a Python interpreter**: Select an existing interpreter/virtual environment or establish a new one for your project.

3. **Install packages**: Choose your dbt-core version and install necessary warehouse adapters (such as Snowflake or BigQuery).

4. **Point to project files**: Specify folders containing `dbt_project.yml` and `profiles.yml`. dazense attempts automatic discovery.

5. **Add environment variables (optional)**: Include secrets or configuration values directly, or reference `.dazense.env` / `.env` files. Existing `.env` values load automatically.

6. **Select the target**: Choose your dbt target from `profiles.yml` (examples: `dev`, `prod`). This selection can be modified later via the bottom left bar.

7. **Enable dbt defer (optional)**: Activate the defer toggle and provide your production `manifest.json`. When editing models, enable **Defer mode** to use production data when development data is unavailable. See the [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/defer) for additional information.

## Verification

A checkmark in the lower-left status bar indicates successful dbt configuration. Should an error symbol appear instead, click the dbt project button to reopen setup and address any incomplete steps.

## Requirements

- **dbt Core only**: dazense supports dbt Core projects exclusively; dbt Cloud users must run a local Core installation.
- **Local environment**: The dbt project must reside on the same machine running dazense; remote environments are unsupported.
