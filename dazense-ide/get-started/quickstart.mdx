Get up and running with dazense in just 4 steps.

1. **Download dazense**
   Download the latest version of dazense from the [download page](https://dazense.metazense.com/download/).

2. **Connect your data**

3. **Open a repository**
   Open your repository or folder so the agent can read files and make edits.

4. **Set up dbt (optional)**
   Configure dbt integration for native model preview, lineage, and dbt tools in agent. See the [dbt setup guide](/dazense-ide/get-started/set-up-dbt).
