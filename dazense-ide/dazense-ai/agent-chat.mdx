---

dazense agent can access and search your **codebase and your data warehouse metadata**.
It can execute queries on your warehouse, run commands for you, and integrate with your data stack through MCPs.

A typical agent flow is:

* A [prompt](#prompting) you send to the agent
* Enriched with [context](/dazense-ide/dazense-ai/agent-context) & [indexing](/dazense-ide/dazense-ai/indexing) of your codebase and data schema
* A specific [agent mode](#agent-mode)
* A [foundational model](/dazense-ide/dazense-ai/agent-models)
* Your own [rules](/dazense-ide/dazense-ai/agent-rules)
* [Tools](/dazense-ide/dazense-ai/agent-tools) executed by the agent

## Prompting

**Smart prompt suggestions**

As you type in the chat, dazense will suggest relevant prompts based on:

* Your current context (open files, selected tables, etc.)
* Common workflows and use cases
* Your project structure and data schema

For more prompt templates, check out our [prompt library](/dazense-ide/learn/prompt-library).

## Agent modes

There are 3 different agent modes: **Chat**, **Edit**, **Plan**.

You can switch modes directly within the agent prompt form, at any point of a conversation.

### Chat

In Chat mode, the agent will answer questions and suggest code changes.
You can then:

* **Apply changes**: Click "Apply" button to see the suggested changes directly applied in your files
* **Accept/reject changes**: Accept or reject each bit of code or all of the code suggested.

### Edit

In Edit mode, the agent will **auto-apply** suggestions. You can always review the changes and decide whether to accept or reject them.

**Edit mode requires an open folder**
The agent can only edit files in open folder and cannot create new files outside of an open workspace.

### Plan

In Plan mode, the agent will first write a plan to answer your request. This mode is mostly useful for long-tasks that require thoughtful planning.
In this mode, the agent won't apply any changes - you can switch to edit mode for the agent to execute the drafted plan.

**Shortcuts to accept / reject / undo apply changes:**

* Accept changes: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>⏎</kbd>
* Reject changes: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>⌫</kbd>
* Undo accept: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>

## Multiple chats

You can run **multiple chats** at the same time within dazense.

They will keep **running in parallel**, even if you switch between multiple chats. You will see a chat is running with a blue dot on it - when it goes away it means the chat has finished its task.

Once you have created multiple chats, you will be able to **rename** them by double clicking it, and **reorder** chat tabs. Every tab will also show you the active changes in the specific chat.

## Chat History

All your chat conversations are saved within dazense.

Each conversation is linked to one folder / repository and can only be retrieved from there.
You can access previous conversations to view them, and continue them from where you left off.

All your chat history is accessible from the history icon on top right of your chat.
