description: "Customize your agent behavior with .naorules and claude.md files at your project root."

## .naorules File

**What you can configure:**

* **Code style**: SQL formatting preferences, naming conventions, code structure
* **Agent behavior**: Language, tone, response style, documentation habits
* **Tool-specific rules**: Include your data stack documentation (Airflow, dbt, etc.)
* **Project standards**: Team conventions, best practices, domain-specific knowledge

**Example .naorules content:**

```
- Always use CTEs for complex SQL queries
- Use snake_case for all table and column names
- Include comments explaining business logic
- Prefer explicit JOINs over implicit joins
- Follow our dbt style guide for model structure
```

## claude.md File

The agent can also read `claude.md` files in your repository. This works similarly to `.naorules` and provides another way to give project-specific guidelines to the agent. You can use both `.naorules` and `claude.md` files together - the agent will read and apply rules from both.

**Multiple Documentation Files**

You can have multiple documentation files that the agent reads:

* `.naorules` - Primary rules file (recommended)
* `claude.md` - Alternative/additional rules file
* Both files are read automatically if present in your project root

## Creating .naorules

1. Go on dazense settings at top right
2. Go to "Agent" section. Scroll down to Chat -> dazense Rules. Click "+Add" to create .naorules at root folder
3. Write in plain english your custom rules!

**Best Practices**

* Keep rules focused and well-organized
* Use clear headings and sections for different rule categories
* Include examples where helpful
* Update rules as your standards evolve
* Test rules by asking the agent to follow them in a conversation
