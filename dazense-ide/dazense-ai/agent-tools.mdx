## MCPs

dazense supports MCP (Model Context Protocol), allowing the agent to integrate with external tools and services through standardized protocols. MCPs enable the agent to access additional capabilities beyond the built-in tools.

**What are MCPs?**

MCPs provide a standardized way for AI agents to interact with external systems, APIs, and tools. This allows dazense to extend its capabilities by connecting to custom tools and services.

MCP integration is available in the agent, allowing you to leverage external tools and services directly within your dazense conversations.

**Pre-integrated MCPs**

dazense comes with several pre-integrated MCPs that you can use immediately:

* Notion: Access and manage Notion pages and databases
* Git: Interact with Git repositories and perform version control operations
* Airbyte: Connect to Airbyte for data integration workflows
* Omni: Integration with Omni tools and services
* Tableau: Access Tableau workbooks and data sources
* Elementary: Data quality and monitoring tools
* Select Star: Data catalog and discovery platform

These MCPs are available out of the box and can be enabled in your dazense settings.

**Adding Custom MCPs**

You can add custom MCPs to extend dazense's capabilities with your own tools and services:

1. Go to Settings > Agent > MCPs
2. Click "Add Custom MCP"
3. Configure your MCP connection details directly in the mcp.json file
4. The agent will have access to your custom MCP tools

## Permissions

You can configure how the agent handles permissions for different actions in Settings > Agent > Chat:

* Query Execution: Choose to always allow, always ask, or use auto-run settings
* Command Execution: Control whether the agent asks before running terminal commands
* Data Sharing: Set default behavior for sharing query results with the LLM (always share, always ask, or use lock toggle)

These settings give you fine-grained control over agent behavior while maintaining security for sensitive operations.
