## Overview

dazense indexes your codebase to provide fast, relevant answers and code suggestions, with the context of your existing repository and data schema.

## Benefits for dazense Agent

The indexing process provides three key advantages:

- Full repository context including structure and code style
- Precise data schema context ensuring generated code matches your data
- Ability to answer questions about your codebase or data warehouse

## Indexed Content

The system indexes:

- All files in your repository (excluding those in `.gitignore` or `.naoignore`)
- All table schemas in your data warehouse

## Automatic Indexing

**If auto-indexing is enabled:**
- Indexing launches automatically when opening a new folder or data connection (takes several minutes)
- Re-indexing triggers automatically every 10 minutes

**If auto-indexing is disabled:**
- Manually trigger indexing from the settings/AI models panel
- Re-activate auto-indexing from this same panel

## Checking Status

Monitor both codebase and warehouse indexing status in the **settings/AI models panel**.

## Privacy & Security

The system stores only "embeddings—the indexing output—on dazense servers." Your actual codebase, data schema, and data content remain completely inaccessible and unindexed locally.
